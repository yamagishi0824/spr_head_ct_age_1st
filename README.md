# SPR Head CT Age Prediction Challenge - 1st Place Solution

This repository contains the 1st place solution for the [SPR Head CT Age Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spr-head-ct-age-prediction-challenge/overview) on Kaggle.

## Overview

The goal of this competition was to predict the age of patients from their head CT scans. Our solution achieved the highest performance in the competition.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following key components:

- `train.ipynb`: Notebook containing the training process of the model.
- `infer.ipynb`: Notebook containing the inference process.
- `preprocess.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing steps.

## Citation

## Usage

1. **Training**: Use `train.ipynb` to train the model on the provided dataset.
2. **Inference**: Use `infer.ipynb` to make predictions on new data.
3. **Preprocessing**: Use `preprocess.ipynb` to preprocess the data before training and inference.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the organizers of the SPR Head CT Age Prediction Challenge and the Kaggle community for their support and collaboration.
