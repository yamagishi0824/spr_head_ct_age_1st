# SPR Head CT Age Prediction Challenge - 1st Place Solution

This repository contains the 1st place solution for the [SPR Head CT Age Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spr-head-ct-age-prediction-challenge/overview) on Kaggle.

## Overview

The goal of this competition was to predict the age of patients from their head CT scans. Our solution achieved the highest performance in the competition.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following key components:

- `train_infer.ipynb`: Notebook containing the training & inference process of the model.
- `preprocess.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing steps. (avalable soon)

## Solution Summary
